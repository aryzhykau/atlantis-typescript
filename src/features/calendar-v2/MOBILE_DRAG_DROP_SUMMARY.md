├── MobileDragHandle.tsx          # Drag handle icon
├── MobileDraggableEventCard.tsx  # Draggable event wrapper
├── MobileDropZone.tsx            # Drop zone component
└── hooks/
    └── useMobileDragDrop.ts      # Mobile DND logic
```

### Integration Points
- **MobileWeekTimeGrid**: Main calendar component with DND provider
- **Event Cards**: Wrapped with draggable functionality
- **Hour Rows**: Each hour slot is a drop zone
- **API Integration**: Uses existing mutation hooks for persistence

### Mobile-Specific Optimizations
- **Touch Events**: Proper touch event handling
- **Visual Feedback**: Mobile-friendly animations and indicators
- **Performance**: Optimized for mobile devices
- **Accessibility**: Touch-friendly sizes and interactions

## 🎨 User Experience Features

### Visual Feedback
- **Drag Handle**: Visible DND icon on event cards
- **Drag State**: Cards show visual feedback during drag
- **Drop Zones**: Highlighted areas show valid drop targets
- **Success Animation**: Confirmation animation on successful drop
- **Error States**: Visual feedback for failed operations

### Mobile UX Considerations
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44px touch targets
- **Scroll Prevention**: Prevents accidental scrolling during drag
- **Visual Cues**: Clear drag handle and drop zone indicators
- **Smooth Animations**: 60fps animations for better feel
- **Error Recovery**: Clear error messaging and state recovery

## 🚀 Next Steps & Potential Enhancements

### Overlap Handling (Partially Implemented)
- **Row Manager**: `MobileEventRowManager` class created but not yet integrated
- **Conflict Detection**: Logic for detecting time slot overlaps
- **Row Assignment**: Automatic assignment of events to visual rows
- **Visual Indicators**: Show conflicts and available slots

### Additional Features (Future)
- **Bulk Operations**: Select and move multiple events
- **Gesture Support**: Pinch to zoom, long press for context menu
- **Offline Support**: Local state management for offline operations
- **Haptic Feedback**: Vibration feedback for touch interactions

## 🔬 Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing
1. **Basic Drag**: Drag events between time slots
2. **Touch Interaction**: Test on mobile devices
3. **Error Scenarios**: Test with network failures
4. **Performance**: Test with many events
5. **Edge Cases**: Test boundary conditions

### Automated Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components
- **Integration Tests**: Test full drag & drop flow
